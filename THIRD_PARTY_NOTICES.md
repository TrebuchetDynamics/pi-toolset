# Third Party Notices

This package bundles selected skills and guidance from upstream open-source repositories.

## Package-wide skill adaptations

Local skill maintenance adds scope-aware shared guidance, persistent session authorization, available-tool fallbacks, and concrete validation boundaries. Selected planning, delivery, engineering, and design workflows were corrected to preserve explicit user intent. Long design entrypoints were split into linked conditional references; their upstream guidance remains attributed to the sources below. These are package-local adaptations, not newer upstream snapshots. Existing licenses and source revisions are preserved. Instruction and packaging checks do not establish a measured skill-on/skill-off behavioral improvement.

## DietrichGebert/ponytail

- Source: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail
- Skills snapshot inspected: `974d940a1c5344210874150b98ff0d2c861fab6a` (4.9.0)
- Pi extension snapshot inspected: `16f2980`
- Bundled paths:
  - `extensions/ponytail/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail-review/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail-audit/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail-gain/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail-debt/`
  - `skills/communication/ponytail-help/`
- Historical usage: inspired implementation guidance in the now-retired Caveman skill.
- Local changes: concise package-local routing descriptions and shared-contract references were added. Help now describes the bundled integration; gain requires verified measurement evidence instead of printing fixed benchmark percentages. The core no longer routes prose to Caveman.

## gcpdev/llm-council-skill

- Source: https://github.com/gcpdev/llm-council-skill
- Snapshot inspected: `0f95431`
- Usage: source inspiration for council-style multi-perspective synthesis in `skills/planning/grill-with-docs/`; the upstream helper script is not bundled.
- License: MIT
- Full license copy: `licenses/gcpdev-llm-council-skill-LICENSE`

## qualisero/awesome-pi-agent

## cathrynlavery/diagram-design

- Source: https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design
- Snapshot inspected: `dc1ace47b99a419e42d01a03cb6ace5346efa8ae`
- Reviewed source: [upstream skill](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design/blob/dc1ace47b99a419e42d01a03cb6ace5346efa8ae/skills/diagram-design/SKILL.md) and [upstream license](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design/blob/dc1ace47b99a419e42d01a03cb6ace5346efa8ae/LICENSE) at that revision.
- Bundled path: `skills/frontend/diagram-design/`
- Local changes: focused text-only adaptation for architecture, sequence, and process diagrams; existing project styles or neutral defaults replace the onboarding gate. Remote fonts, upstream templates, import/export scripts, motion controllers, profiles, and installer are not bundled. Simple Markdown diagrams remain eligible for Mermaid.
- Security assumptions: instructions and review scenarios only; generated output defaults to static offline HTML/SVG. Source/packaging review does not establish safety or measured behavioral improvement; paired evaluation is unreplicated.

## en970/ui-vault

- Source: https://github.com/en970/ui-vault
- Snapshot inspected: `2b199ea33df34ae6bb974796fb0af20fd7cc49e8`
- Bundled paths:
  - `skills/frontend/ui-vault/references/catalog.json`
- Local changes: extracted the `DATA` resource catalog from the pinned `index.html`; added package-local search and proposal guidance.
- Security assumptions: the catalog is inert JSON; linked resources are recommendations only and must be re-verified before adoption.

- Snapshot inspected: `4119e6a7c58d1b48fe883784133413391b148180`
- Bundled paths:
  - `skills/frontend/beautify-github-readme/`
- Local changes: narrowed package routing, added package-relative helper execution, an explicit output contract, provenance frontmatter, and shared-contract guidance.
- Security assumptions: the bundled Python audit helper is read-only, uses only the standard library, and receives the target README path explicitly.

## Lum1104/Understand-Anything

- Source: https://github.com/Lum1104/Understand-Anything
- Snapshot inspected: `6ae7187`
- Usage: the local `/understand` extension can clone and load the upstream Understand-Anything skills from a user checkout; no upstream code is bundled in this package tarball.
- License: MIT

## TrebuchetDynamics/research-forge

- Source: https://github.com/TrebuchetDynamics/research-forge
- Snapshot inspected: `3f7c113e48fb` (local checkout inspected; upstream docs/skill workflow)

## jeff-phil/pi-posher

- Source: https://github.com/jeff-phil/pi-posher
- Bundled version: `0.3.2` (`d04ab1f98cf332cbe693236d2ece448cf21a47c2`)
- Bundled path: `node_modules/pi-posher/` through the package's `bundledDependencies`
- Security assumptions: global defaults are user-owned and may run formatter, linter, package-manager, and SAST commands after edits; project-local `.pi/poshifiers.json` commands require hash-based trust and are rejected in non-interactive mode.
- License: MIT
- Full license copy: `licenses/jeff-phil-pi-posher-LICENSE`

## nicobailon/pi-subagents

- Source: https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents
- Bundled version: `0.40.0` (`d4d2ab706b612ccd173caad2bc202eef07e7eda3` inspected)
- Bundled paths:
  - `node_modules/pi-subagents/` through the package's `bundledDependencies`
  - `skills/pi/pi-subagents/`
- Local integration: `extensions/pi-subagents/index.js` re-exports the bundled extension; the orchestration skill adds the package shared-contract reference.
- Security assumptions: the extension can spawn child Pi or explicitly configured external CLI processes, read and write Pi settings and run artifacts, and give child agents configured filesystem or shell tools. It does not launch work until invoked or explicitly scheduled/configured.
- License: MIT
- Full license copy: `licenses/nicobailon-pi-subagents-LICENSE`

## rtk-ai/rtk

- Source: https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk
- Snapshot inspected: `bee2178` (upstream version 0.42.4)
- Usage: source evidence for the package-local `extensions/rtk/index.js` Pi command-rewrite integration; the Rust RTK binary is not bundled in this package tarball.
- License: Apache-2.0
- Full license copy: `licenses/rtk-ai-rtk-LICENSE`

## MasuRii/pi-rtk-optimizer

- Snapshot inspected: `0ec4ea1fd13ca47dc22d9d0c61742356b290afd1`
- Usage: source inspiration for the package-local `extensions/rtk/index.js` rewrite status cache, suggestion mode, session stats, and tool output compaction pipeline; the upstream extension is not bundled wholesale.
- License: MIT
- Full license copy: `licenses/MasuRii-pi-rtk-optimizer-LICENSE`

## tolibear/goalbuddy

- Source: https://github.com/tolibear/goalbuddy
- Snapshot inspected: v0.3.7 repository snapshot on 2026-05-23
- Usage: behavior-pattern inspiration for local goal-discipline skills and docs; no GoalBuddy code is bundled.

## narumiruna/pi-extensions pi-goal

- Source: https://github.com/narumiruna/pi-extensions/tree/main/extensions/pi-goal
- Bundled package: `@narumitw/pi-goal@0.49.3` (`4c2c2e8c4b6c3d21659110ea1966810b1d15e045`)
- Bundled path: `node_modules/@narumitw/pi-goal/` through the package's `bundledDependencies`
- Local integration: `extensions/goal/index.js` re-exports the bundled extension, replacing the previous local Goal runtime.
- Security assumptions: Goal continuation can initiate repeated model turns until completion or a configured safety limit; settings writes are confined to the Pi agent directory and require explicit user interaction.

# External Superpowers workflow

The profile installer fetches the unmodified MIT-licensed `obra/superpowers`
repository at revision `5bf4e78011075bcfc0dc295f0724994cd123ee71` (6.4.1).
Its 15 skills and native Pi bootstrap remain in the upstream checkout, including
the upstream LICENSE. They are not copied into this package's source catalog.
The revision and profile inventory are recorded in `skills/shared/profiles.json`.
