# UI Design Orchestrator

Use this as the front door for UI/UX work. Route to the smallest useful set of design skills, keep them from conflicting, and finish with concrete UI quality evidence.

## Quick start

1. Classify the request: build, redesign, audit, design-system, implementation polish, Stitch handoff, or browser-platform guidance.
2. Pick a primary skill and at most two support skills from the routing table.
3. State the design read, files/surfaces likely affected, and validation evidence before editing.
4. Implement or review using the selected skill rules; do not stack every design skill by default.

## Routing table

| Request shape | Primary skill | Support skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Broad UI/UX decision, visual system, colors, typography, layout, accessibility, motion | `ui-ux-pro-max` | `modern-web-guidance` for browser APIs/perf |
| Resource-backed improvement proposal for one selected webpage | `ui-vault` | `ui-ux-pro-max` only for deeper design-system checks |
| Standalone architecture, sequence, or process diagram | `diagram-design` | None by default |
| UI design-smell audit, AI-slop detection, hierarchy/accessibility/state review | `hallmark` | `ui-ux-pro-max`; `modern-web-guidance` when browser behavior matters |
| Fresh distinctive web UI, page, component, or app | `frontend-design` | `hallmark` for anti-slop structure; `ui-ux-pro-max` for checks |
| React + TypeScript + Tailwind product UI, including shadcn-style systems | `frontend-design` | `ui-ux-pro-max`; `modern-web-guidance` |
| Landing page, portfolio, or marketing redesign where taste matters | `design-taste-frontend` | `gpt-taste` for stricter Codex/GPT taste; `hallmark`; `frontend-design` |
| Existing-site visual upgrade | `redesign-existing-projects` | `design-taste-frontend`; `hallmark` |
| Specific aesthetic already chosen: minimalist, brutalist, or soft premium | `minimalist-ui`, `industrial-brutalist-ui`, or `high-end-visual-design` | `design-taste-frontend`; `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Image-first website implementation | `image-to-code` | `imagegen-frontend-web`; `frontend-design` |
| Website, mobile, or brand-kit reference image generation | `imagegen-frontend-web`, `imagegen-frontend-mobile`, or `brandkit` | `design-taste-frontend` for web taste constraints |
| Anti-AI-slop build, audit, redesign, or study from URL/screenshot | `hallmark` | `design-taste-frontend`; `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Create Stitch design guidance | `stitch-design-taste` | `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Convert Stitch designs into Vite/React components | `stitch-react-components` | `frontend-design`; `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Browser UX behavior, HTML/CSS/Web APIs, performance, forms, or accessibility details | `modern-web-guidance` | `ui-ux-pro-max` |
| Chrome/browser extension UI or extension APIs | `chrome-extensions` | `modern-web-guidance`; `ui-ux-pro-max` |

## Conflict rules

- Product app/dashboard beats marketing taste: prefer `frontend-design` with existing system conventions over `design-taste-frontend`.
- Existing brand/system beats novelty: preserve tokens, routes, components, content intent, and accessibility before adding flair.
- Stitch fidelity beats reinvention: for Stitch inputs, use `stitch-react-components` first, then polish.
- Anti-slop does not mean maximalism: choose a clear aesthetic, then execute consistently.
- If two skills disagree, prioritize: accessibility → product intent → existing system → implementation constraints → visual novelty.

## Workflow

1. **Design read**: one line naming surface, audience, vibe, stack, and primary skill.
2. **Repo/UI study**: inspect existing components, routes, tokens, screenshots, tests, design docs, and `codebase-map-understand.md` when present. Query codebase map for route/component/data-flow leads on broad UI changes, then verify named files.
3. **Plan**: list exact files expected to change; ask before destructive route/component removal.
4. **Execute**: load/read the selected skill guidance and apply only relevant checks.
5. **Verify**: run available tests/build/lint; inspect responsive states, focus/keyboard behavior, contrast, loading/error/empty states, and reduced-motion where applicable. For autonomous layout/design changes, gather visual-state evidence: screenshot/browser inspection when tooling exists, or explicitly state the limitation and use DOM/CSS/test evidence instead.
6. **Report**: name selected skills, important design decisions, files changed, visual evidence or limitation, and validation results.

## Design-smell audit checklist

Before implementing broad UI polish, scan for generic-template smell, weak hierarchy, inconsistent spacing rhythm, poor contrast, missing focus/keyboard states, loading/error/empty-state gaps, responsive breakage, excessive motion, and mismatch with the existing design system. Fix only issues visible in the scoped surface.

## Red lines

- Do not delete or replace a design system, route tree, production page, or component library without explicit approval.
- Do not copy protected site designs, screenshots, or brand assets beyond user-provided/authorized references.
- Do not invent unavailable Stitch/MCP/browser tooling; report the missing tool and offer a local fallback.
