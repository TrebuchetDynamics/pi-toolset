# Architecture Deepening Mode

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability: one small interface, one high-leverage implementation, and tests that cross the same seam as callers.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion. Consistent language is the point — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Full definitions in [architecture-language.md](architecture-language.md).

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. **Deep** = high leverage. **Shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place. (Use this, not "boundary.")
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge concentrated in one place.

Key principles (see [architecture-language.md](architecture-language.md) for the full list):

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

Architecture mode is _informed_ by the project's domain model. The domain language gives names to good seams; ADRs record decisions the skill should not re-litigate.

## Skill handoffs

- Use evidence from `diagnose` when a bug exposed missing locality, hidden coupling, or no correct test seam; preserve the repro artifact and expected deeper-seam success signal.
- Use failed/frustrating `tdd` planning as input when the public interface is too wide, too shallow, or unstable; preserve the testability artifact.
- Use `grill-with-docs` after selecting a candidate so domain terms and durable decisions land in CONTEXT.md or ADRs.
- Use `prototype` when two possible seams look plausible and a throwaway model can answer which has more leverage.
- Return to `tdd` with the chosen interface, target tests, and success signal so behavior is locked at the new seam.

## Process

### 1. Study the repo before proposing architecture

**Codebase map startup gate:** architecture mode must check for `codebase-map-understand.md` before broad architecture study. If it exists, read it first and record the map path in study evidence. If it does not exist and the repo is not tiny, ask before generating `/understand agent` artifacts unless the user already requested map generation. Map facts are leads only: verify every named file, caller, and test against live source before reporting.

Start with the repository's own evidence, not generic heuristics. Inspect:

1. repo instructions and git state (`AGENTS.md`, `git status --short --branch`), then classify dirty files as in-scope evidence, unrelated owner work, or blocker before relying on them;
2. orientation docs (`README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `CONTEXT-MAP.md`, `docs/adr/`, `TODO.md`/plans when present);
3. `codebase-map-understand.md` when present, then the exact files it points to;
4. codebase map evidence from the startup gate: architecture paths, callers, hotspots, and cross-module edges, then the exact live files it names;
5. package/app manifests, validation scripts, and tests for the area;
6. callers and callees around each suspected seam using `rg`, `find`, and targeted reads.

Build working study notes with domain terms, ADR constraints, hot paths, caller/test evidence, validation commands, dirty-worktree classification, and candidate friction. Do not write repo files during exploration unless the user asked for durable docs.

Explore organically and record where you feel friction:

- understanding one concept requires bouncing between many small modules;
- a module is shallow — interface nearly as complex as implementation;
- pure functions were extracted for testability, but real bugs hide in orchestration;
- tightly-coupled modules leak across seams;
- tests pierce implementation details or miss the behaviour behind the interface.

For every candidate, verify at least one caller path and one test/validation path. Apply the **deletion test**: would deleting the module concentrate complexity, or just move it? A "yes, concentrates" is the signal you want. Classify the dependency shape with [architecture-deepening-dependencies.md](architecture-deepening-dependencies.md): `in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, or `mock`.

Study quality gate before reporting:

- at least two evidence-backed candidates, unless the repo area is too small;
- no candidate without caller evidence, validation evidence, and deletion-test result;
- no stale generated map used without checking the live files it names;
- no production-code edits during exploration;
- no candidate based on uncommitted changes unless those paths are explicitly classified as in-scope evidence or accepted user work.

See [architecture-repo-study.md](architecture-repo-study.md) for the full evidence checklist and confidence rubric.

### 2. Present candidates inline

Produce an inline Markdown architecture review. Do not write a separate HTML file and do not create repo artifacts unless the user explicitly asks to save a report.

For each candidate, include:

- **Title** — short, names the deepening;
- **Recommendation strength** — `Strong`, `Worth exploring`, or `Speculative`;
- **Dependency category** — `in-process`, `local-substitutable`, `ports & adapters`, or `mock` from [architecture-deepening-dependencies.md](architecture-deepening-dependencies.md);
- **Files** — involved files/modules;
- **Study evidence** — docs, callers, tests, commands, map facts, dirty-worktree classification, and deletion-test result;
- **Problem** — one sentence on what hurts;
- **Solution** — one sentence on what changes;
- **Wins** — terse bullets naming locality, leverage, and testability gains;
- **Before / After sketch** — a compact text sketch, bullet list, or Mermaid-style code block when it clarifies the module/seam change.

End with a **Top recommendation** section: which candidate to tackle first and why, based on the strongest locality/leverage proof rather than the biggest file or easiest diff.

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain, and [architecture-language.md](architecture-language.md) vocabulary for the architecture.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler," and not "the Order service."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR. Mark it clearly in the candidate. Don't list every theoretical refactor an ADR forbids.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. After the review, report:

```text
Architecture review: inline
Evidence base: <docs/tests/commands/maps inspected>
Top recommendation: <candidate>
Next question: Which of these would you like to explore?
```

### 3. Approval continuation

If the user replies with `lgtm`, `go ahead`, `approved`, or similar after the report, treat it as selecting the **Top recommendation** unless they named a different candidate. Do not ask the same exploration question again.

Continue according to the candidate type:

- **Mechanical cleanup** (delete an unused duplicate Module, remove an obsolete export, move code behind an already-chosen seam): restate the accepted candidate, inspect the exact live files and git diff, make the smallest safe edit, then run the focused validation path from the review plus package/project validation when available.
- **Design-bearing refactor** (new Interface, new Adapter, cross-module migration, ADR-sensitive change): restate the accepted candidate and enter the grilling loop before editing production code.
- **Risky or unclear ownership** (dirty unrelated worktree, destructive deletion without caller/test proof, broad migration): stop and report the blocker or ask one hard ownership question.

For mechanical cleanup, the review phase is over once the user approves the candidate; production-code edits are allowed only inside the accepted candidate's blast radius and only with validation evidence.

### 4. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a design-bearing candidate, drop into a grilling conversation. Walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened Module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline as decisions crystallize:

- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in `CONTEXT.md`?** Add the term to `CONTEXT.md` — same discipline as `/grill-with-docs` (see [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](CONTEXT-FORMAT.md)). Create the file lazily if it doesn't exist.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term during the conversation?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR, framed as: _"Want me to record this as an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it?"_ Only offer when the reason would actually be needed by a future explorer to avoid re-suggesting the same thing — skip ephemeral reasons and self-evident ones. See [ADR-FORMAT.md](ADR-FORMAT.md).
- **Want to explore alternative interfaces for the deepened module?** See [architecture-interface-design.md](architecture-interface-design.md).

## Red lines

- Do not produce a generic architecture review without repo evidence.
- Do not include a candidate that only says "make it cleaner" or "split this up" without locality/leverage proof.
- Do not edit production code during the review phase.
- Do not write architecture report artifacts into the repository unless explicitly asked.
